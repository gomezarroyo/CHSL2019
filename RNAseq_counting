# COUNTING AND DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION

This uses data from HBR and UHR exercise from rnabio.org

NOTES
Choose a tool for counting. In this case we will use Stringtie because it can help you count isoforms as well (as opposed to Deseq or HTseq). 

1) StringTie will help you count but taking into account isoforms instead of just globally adding all transcript levels together. 
2)Some Basic stringie stuff. 
  - Merge all gene structures from all samples 
    - this makes a new reference file that will include transcripts with assembled and potentially novel transcripts
  - Then re-run against your de novo transcriptome from all samples -- this will help understand count levels of isoforms that may have not been found from sample to sample. 
  3) Then you will get total transcript levels plus isoform transcript levels. 
  

```
cd $RNA_HOME/
~/workspace/rnaseq

mkdir -p expression/stringtie/ref_only/

stringtie -p 8 -G $RNA_REF_GTF -e -B -o HBR_Rep1/transcripts.gtf -A HBR_Rep1/gene_abundances.tsv $RNA_ALIGN_DIR/HBR_Rep1.bam

# -G use the reference GTF. if you don't use it then it will go ALL de novo
# -e explore only known isoforms. if you remove it it will try to find new from within the GTF
# -B ouput for BallGown
# -o output Path
